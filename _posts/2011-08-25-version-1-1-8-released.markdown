# Version 1.1.8 is released!

This release contains bug fixes to the optimization methods. It also contains a workaround to a JRE bug that prevents running OpenRocket on some builds of Java 7.

The web pages have also been somewhat updated and Boris du Reau has created a separate site for coordinating the localization efforts for OpenRocket.
