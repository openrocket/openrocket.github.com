# Version 1.1.7 is released!

This release includes automatic rocket design optimization support (Analyze → Rocket optimization). You can optimize any amount of rocket parameters for apogee altitude, maximum velocity or a number of different values.

While the automatic optimization is a powerful tool, it is very easy to optimize against particulars of the simulation methods, instead of true physical phenomena. Always keep common sense at hand and take the results with a grain of salt.
