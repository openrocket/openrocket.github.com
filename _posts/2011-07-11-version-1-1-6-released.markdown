# Version 1.1.6 is released!

This release includes initial localization support and translations to French, German and Spanish. This is thanks to the great work of Boris du Reau, and the teams from Tripoli France, Tripoli Spain and ERIG e.V. If you prefer to use some other language than the system default, you can select the language on the "Options" tab of the preferences dialog.

The release also includes design scaling support and numerous bug fixes.
