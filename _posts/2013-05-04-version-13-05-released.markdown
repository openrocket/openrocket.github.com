# Version 13.05 is released!

This release contains a huge number of improvements, the main ones including realistic 3D rendering with decals, flight configurations, lower stage descent simulation, boosted dart support and new translations for Portuguese and Japanese. These are thanks to many contributors.

<!-- bump -->

Version 13.05 also changes the file format to be ZIP-based. Versions earlier than 12.03 will not be able to read files saved by this version.
