# Version 1.1.1 is released!

For this release a major part of the simulator code has been rewritten for better flexibility in future development. It also includes a vastly improved thrust curve selection dialog, the possibility to loading user-defined thrust curves and better startup times than previous releases.

Simulation listeners written for older versions of OpenRocket are not compatible with this release.
