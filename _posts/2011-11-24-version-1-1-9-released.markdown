# Version 1.1.9 is released!

For this version Richard Graham has implemented geodetic computation methods, which take into account the curvature of the Earth and the coriolis effect. The computation method is selected by the Geodetic calculations option in the simulation options. It's not (yet) a full spherical computation model, but should be accurate enough for almost all sub-orbital needs.

Doug Pedrick has also enhanced the printing system with the ability to print fin positioning guides, transition templates and nose cone profiles. Other smaller enhancements and bug fixes are also included.
